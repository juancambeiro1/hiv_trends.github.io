<h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that attacks and
weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off
other infections and diseases. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is the most advanced stage of HIV infection, when the immune system is
severely weakened and the body is unable to fight off life-threatening
infections and diseases.</p>
<p>The first cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in the United States in the
early 1980s, and the disease quickly spread around the world. In the
early years of the epidemic, HIV/AIDS was associated with specific risk
groups, such as gay men and intravenous drug users. However, as the
disease spread, it became clear that anyone could contract HIV,
regardless of their sexual orientation or lifestyle.</p>
<p>Over the past several decades, significant progress has been made in
the fight against HIV/AIDS. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly
improved the health and longevity of people living with HIV, and the use
of condoms and other preventive measures has helped to reduce the spread
of the virus.</p>
<p>However, HIV/AIDS remains a major global health problem, with
millions of new infections and deaths each year. It continues to wreak
devastating impacts across the world, and in particular in
low-and-middle income countries that have limited resources to address
it. It is therefore important and timely to study trends in HIV/AIDS in
countries across the world as well as stratified by sociodemographic
variables to determine communities and subgroups who are most impacted
by the disease. Furthermore, it is important to determine the predictors
of HIV/AIDS deaths to develop targeted policies and legislation that can
prevent or slow the spread of HIV/AIDS.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Related work</h3>
<p>We had originally planned our final project to be about monkeypox
case trends in NYC, given that timeliness of the issue. But as we were
looking over our datasets for merging and exploratory analysis, we
realized that we do not actually have that much to work with when it
comes to the NYC monkeypox cases dataset since the monkeypox cases are
not stratified by any variables like age or sex.</p>
<p>We got the idea to do the same analysis we had intended for monkeypox
but for HIV/AIDS after reading an <a
href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1131092">article</a> about
how progress on HIV treatment and prevention has flatlined over the past
3 years. We thus proceeded with the HIV/AIDS project idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial questions</h3>
<p>We first wanted to assess how the HIV/AIDS epidemic had unfolded over
time, specifically focusing on general trends, differences by sex,
differences by age, and the relationship between how developed a country
is (GDP) and HIV/AIDS mortality rate across time.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Our final data set contained 60000 observations with 11
variables.Some important variables include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>country_name</code> : Country corresponding to data.</li>
<li><code>year</code> : Year corresponding to data.</li>
<li><code>gdp_per_capita</code> : Measure of a countries
development.</li>
<li><code>population</code> : Total population size.</li>
<li><code>sex_id</code></li>
<li><code>age_name</code> : Age group (e.g., “0-9”, “10-24”,
“25-49”,“50-74”,“75+”)</li>
<li><code>val</code> : Number of HIV/AIDS deaths</li>
</ul>
<p>his data set was created by merging three separate data sets
containing information on HIV deaths, GDP per capita and population by
country respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
<p>We wanted to determine global trends of HIV deaths over time. We
plotted estimated global HIV mortality per 100k population across 200
countries from 1990 to 2019. We did this by first grouping by year, then
generating a sum of HIV mortality per 100k population for all countries
for each year between 1990 and 2019. We then plotted the sum of HIV
mortality per 100k population against years using ggplot. We also used
transition reveal to reveal HIV mortality per 100k population gradually
with increasing years. Based on the figure generated, the global HIV
mortality rate. The estimated global HIV mortality rate increased from
1990, reached a peak in 2004, and decreased from 2005 to 2019. We then
wanted to determine global trends of HIV deaths over time, stratified by
sex. We plotted estimated global HIV mortality per 100k population
across 200 countries from 1990 to 2019, stratified by sex. We did this
by first grouping by year and sex, then generating a sum of HIV
mortality per 100k population for all countries for each year between
1990 and 2019, stratified by both year and sex. We then plotted the sum
of HIV mortality per 100k population against years, for females and
males respectively, using ggplot. We also used transition reveal to
reveal HIV mortality per 100k population for females and males gradually
with increasing years. Based on the figure generated, the trajectories
of estimated global HIV mortality for females and males from 1990 to
2019 were similar. Before 1994 and after 2015, the difference in the HIV
mortality rate between females and males was virtually
indistinguishable. But from 1994 to 2015, the yearly global HIV
mortality rate for females was higher than that for males.</p>
<p>Additionally, We also wanted to determine global trends of HIV deaths
over time, stratified by age groups (0-9 years, 10-24 years, 25-49
years, 50-74 years and 75+ years). We plotted estimated global HIV
mortality per 100k population across 200 countries from 1990 to 2019,
stratified by age groups. We did this by first grouping by year and age
group, then generating a sum of HIV mortality per 100k population for
all countries for each year between 1990 and 2019, stratified by both
year and age group. We then plotted the sum of HIV mortality per 100k
population against years, for each of the different age groups, using
ggplot. We also used transition reveal to reveal HIV mortality per 100k
population for the age groups gradually with increasing years.
Generally, the estimated global HIV mortality rates from 1990 to 2019
were the highest among young or middle-aged adults (25-49 years), and
were the lowest among the elderly (75+ years). Among young or
middle-aged adults, the global HIV mortality rate changed the most from
1990 to 2019, with the peak occurring in 2004. The mortality trends were
more stable for people in other age groups (0-9 years, 10-24 years,
50-74 years, and 75+ years). Among the people aged over 75 years old,
the global HIV mortality rates during the 30 years were low and
stable.</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to explore the relationship between GDP per capita
and HIV deaths over time. In order to do this, we created a plot with
GDP per capita on our x-axis and HIV mortality rate per 100k on our
y-axis. We first grouped our data by year, country, and GDP per capita,
then generated a sum of HIV mortality per 100k population for every
country for each year between 1990 and 2019. Using ggplot, we then
created a scatter plot, plotting each country’s GDP per capita against
their given HIV mortality rate. We also employed transition time in
order to assess how this relationship had changed over time. In general,
there seemed to be a non-linear negative association between GDP and HIV
mortality rate. This may be indicative of the fact that poorer countries
do not have adequate resources to avert otherwise preventable HIV/AIDS
deaths.</p>
<p>We additionally wanted to examine how countries rank in terms of
their numbers of HIV deaths across the years. We first created a table
showing the top 10 countries with the highest total number of HIV
deaths. In order to do this, we grouped our data by country and summed
together their total amount of HIV deaths from 1990 to 2019. Next, we
arranged this data in descending order and selected the first 10,
yielding a table showing the top 10 countries. This table revealed that
South Africa had the highest total number of HIV deaths across the
years, with a total of 4,864,295, which was over two million more than
the second ranked country, Kenya. In addition to this, we also created a
visualization showing how the total number of HIV deaths had changed
from 1990-2019 for the top 10 countries. This visualization was created
in ggplot and used transition states and animation to show how rankings
and total HIV death counts changed from year to year. This visualization
allowed us to gain a better insight into how the HIV/AIDS epidemic has
unfolded in each respective country over the years. For example, in the
early 1990s, South Africa had relatively few deaths in comparison to the
other countries in our list, but they quickly rose to the top in the
2000s.</p>
<p>We also wanted to examine how countries rank in terms of total number
of HIV deaths, controlling for the population size (per 100k). Similar
to the prior analysis, we first created a table showing the top 10
countries with the highest HIV mortality per 100k. This was done by
grouping our data by both year and county and summing the total number
of HIV deaths per 100k. Next, we arranged this data in descending order
and selected the first 10, yielding a table showing the top 10
countries. Differing from the unadjusted HIV death rankings, Lesotho’s
had the highest rate of HIV mortality per 100k, followed by Eswatini and
Zimbabwe. In addition to this table, we also created a table featuring
the countries with the top 10 countries with the lowest HIV mortality
rate per 100k. This table was created in a similar fashion to the
previous table, but instead, we ranked the data in ascending order. Data
showed that Albania had the lowest total HIV rate per 100k, followed by
Slovakia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Corresponding visualizations were
made for both the top 10 highest and top 10 lowest countries to show how
the rankings and HIV mortality rate had changed by year. This was done
using ggplot with transition states and animation. An interesting
takeaway from these visualizations is that some countries in the top 10
lowest list had an HIV mortality rate of zero for a better part of the
1990s. Eventually all countries were touched by this epidemic in some
form though.</p>
</div>
<div id="regression-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
<p>Our regression models are built around answering our initial
questions: does HIV/AIDS mortality differ between different sexes, age
groups, and the level of development of the countries? If so, how
meaningful are these differences?</p>
<p>First, we hypothesized that HIV/AIDS mortality rate for each country
is associated with gender, age, year, and GDP per capita (a proxy of the
level of development). This hypothesis is validated by the output of the
model. All the covariates (gender, age groups, year, and GDP) are all
statistically significant at the level of 5%. Notably, the age group
that has the highest HIV/AIDS mortality is the 25-49 years old after
controlling for other covariates. It is 9.26 times the mortality rate of
the 0-9 years old.</p>
<p>Second, we wanted to further explore the change of HIV/AIDS mortality
over time. From the graphs for exploratory analysis, we saw the
mortality rate of HIV/AIDS dropped after the year 2004. So, we wanted to
know if the mortality rate is significantly different before and after
2004. The second model with the “year 2004” indicator variable shows
that the HIV deaths per 100k is 44.51% lower before 2004 than after 2004
at the level of 5% significance, after controlling for age, sex, and
GDP.</p>
<p>Third, we would like to explore whether HIV/AIDS mortality could
differ by sex for the same age groups. By adding interaction terms
between sex and age groups, we were able to confirm that sex can have
differential impacts on mortality by age group.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>By analyzing the dataset which included the estimated HIV mortality
per 100k population among 200 countries from 1990 to 2019, we observed
that the global trend of HIV mortality showed a bell shape, with a peak
in 2004. In the adjusted logistic regression models, HIV mortality was
associated with age groups (0-9 years, 10-24 years, 25-49 years, 50-74
years, and 75+ years), sex (females and males), GDP per capita, and the
interaction between age and sex. Compared to males, females had a higher
odds of HIV mortality. Adults aged between 25 to 49 years old had the
highest HIV mortality among all populations, while the elderly aged over
75 years old had the lowest HIV mortality. HIV mortality was negatively
associated with country GDP per capita.</p>
<p>Before 2004, HIV mortality increased steeply by year. Since 2000,
remarkable progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of
persons living with HIV/AIDS, which has contributed to the decline of
global HIV mortality. However, many people with HIV still do not have
access to prevention, care, and treatment, especially in the countries
under poverty. Women and young or middle-aged adults are two populations
with high risk of HIV mortality. This is probably because in many
countries women have a limited role in sexual decision-making and
protection. Moreover, young or middle-aged adults are more likely to
have particular HIV risk behaviors, including sexual activity and drug
abuse.</p>
<p>A few limitations should not be neglected. Some potential risk
factors (e.g., race, education levels, sexual activities, drug abuse)
were not included in this study. In addition, many countries lack the
information on GDP per capita as well as on population size, which
reduces the statistical power.</p>
<p>The large dataset provides a comprehensive picture of global HIV
mortality over a 30-year period. Our findings call for more attention to
the populations and countries at high risk of HIV mortality.</p>
