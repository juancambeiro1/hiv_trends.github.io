# HIV/AIDS Timeline

Below is a timeline of major events of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is useful contextualizing subsequent analysis of major trends.

                   "U.S. CDC notes that the primary route of infection is sexual contact. Transmission does not occur through casual contact, food, air, or surfaces.",
