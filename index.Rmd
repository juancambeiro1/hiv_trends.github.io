# Background

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is a virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is one of the worldâ€™s most pressing public health challenges. Since the time it was identified, tens of millions of deaths due to HIV/AIDS have occurred. HIV/AIDS is an ongoing pandemic that continues to wreak devastating impacts across the world, and in particular in low-and-middle income countries that have limited resources to address it. It is therefore important and timely to study trends in HIV/AIDS in countries across the world as well as stratified by sociodemographic variables to determine communities and subgroups who are most impacted by the disease. Furthermore, it is important to determine the predictors of HIV/AIDS deaths to develop targeted policies and legislation that can prevent or slow the spread of HIV/AIDS.

Our project proposal can be found [here](proposal.html).

# Data

We combine a complex set of datasets from the following websites:

* HIV/AIDS deaths data by country 1990-2019, by sex and by age group, from the [2019 Global Burden of Disease Study](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results?params=gbd-api-2019-permalink/4065269292a8a53e41715ff2e8415266). 

* GDP per capita (current US$) by country from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD).

* Population totals by country(which will allow for adjustment by population size) from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL).
