### Background and Motivation

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that attacks and weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off other infections and diseases. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the most advanced stage of HIV infection, when the immune system is severely weakened and the body is unable to fight off life-threatening infections and diseases.

The first cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in the United States in the early 1980s, and the disease quickly spread around the world. In the early years of the epidemic, HIV/AIDS was associated with specific risk groups, such as gay men and intravenous drug users. However, as the disease spread, it became clear that anyone could contract HIV, regardless of their sexual orientation or lifestyle.

Over the past several decades, significant progress has been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly improved the health and longevity of people living with HIV, and the use of condoms and other preventive measures has helped to reduce the spread of the virus. 

However, HIV/AIDS remains a major global health problem, with millions of new infections and deaths each year. It continues to wreak devastating impacts across the world, and in particular in low-and-middle income countries that have limited resources to address it. It is therefore important and timely to study trends in HIV/AIDS in countries across the world as well as stratified by sociodemographic variables to determine communities and subgroups who are most impacted by the disease. Furthermore, it is important to determine the predictors of HIV/AIDS deaths to develop targeted policies and legislation that can prevent or slow the spread of HIV/AIDS.

### Related work

We had originally planned our final project to be about monkeypox case trends in NYC, given that timeliness of the issue. But as we were looking over our datasets for merging and exploratory analysis, we realized that we do not actually have that much to work with when it comes to the NYC monkeypox cases dataset since the monkeypox cases are not stratified by any variables like age or sex. 

We got the idea to do the same analysis we had intended for monkeypox but for HIV/AIDS after reading an [article](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1131092) about how progress on HIV treatment and prevention has flatlined over the past 3 years. We thus proceeded with the HIV/AIDS project idea.
